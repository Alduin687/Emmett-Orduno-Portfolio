        <h2>PROFILE</h2>
        <p>
          I am Emmett Orduno, a creative storyteller with knowledge in more than 3 fields of work, focusing hard on story writing, music, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          I eventually want to get into video game design as my biggest skills have led me to a point of no return as I've got plenty of ambition for what I love doing, which is leading people through a piece of my mind, though it seems too deep to put on a resume, that's just what I want.

            <h4>Trion Supercars <span>2024 - 2025</span></h4>
            <p><strong>Intern Web Developer</strong></p>
            <p>Me and my team worked together on making a working website for Trion to sell their cars through while having great competition in this as we weren't the only team working on one of these websites.</p>

            <h4>Isabel Orduno Photography <span>2023 - 2024</span></h4>
            <p><strong>Set up</strong></p>
            <p>I used to help my cousin's mom with the setup of her lights out on Pismo Beach for wedding photos. This led to me getting into my basis of taking photos of sprawling landscapes and pin-point images of people at the precipice of imposing nature.</p>

            <h4>Ooooby <span>2022 - 2023</span></h4>
            <p><strong>Distribution and setup</strong></p>
            <p>My father used to work for an organic goods company as a distributor meaning he'd go from house to house giving boxes of fresh produce to people that were subscribed to the service. I'd usually tag along to help with boxes while my dad talked to the customer. This led to me helping with setting up their second location before closing down.</p>
